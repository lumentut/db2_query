Description:
  Stubs out a new query. Pass the query name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of its methods as arguments.

    To create a query within a module, just use namespace pattern as the other rails generators do.

    To create query class methods, you can use 3 options:
      1. Plain SQL methods --defines
      2. Query Methods with SQL string, --queries
      3. Query Methods with lambda, --lambdas

Example:
  `rails g query NameSpace::Name --queries query_1 --defines query_2 --lambdas query_3`

This will create file `app/queries/name_space/name_query.rb`
